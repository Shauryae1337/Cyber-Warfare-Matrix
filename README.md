### ⚔️ A Strategic Framework for Understanding State-Level Cyber Conflict

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

The **Cyber Warfare Matrix** is a structured, dynamic framework crafted to map out the **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** employed in **state-sponsored** or **advanced cyber warfare operations**. Drawing inspiration from well-established cybersecurity knowledge bases, this matrix adapts that structure specifically for the **strategic domain of cyber conflict** between nation-states and sophisticated adversaries.

> 📚 *Its mission is to serve as a living knowledge base and analytical tool to understand the full scope, intent, and execution of cyber warfare campaigns.*

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts

The matrix is organized into a clear, hierarchical structure:

### 🎯 1. Tactics
High-level **strategic goals** pursued through cyber means during conflicts or competition.

Examples:
- Attacking Critical Infrastructure
- Targeting Research & Development / Technology Sectors
- Undermining Economic Systems
- *(And more as defined in the full dataset)*

---

### 🛠️ 2. Techniques
Specific **technical or operational methods** used to achieve a given tactic.

Examples:
- Disrupting Nuclear Infrastructure *(under Attacking Infrastructure)*
- Stealing Pharmaceutical Research *(under Attacking R&D)*
- Disrupting Banking Systems *(under Attacking Economy)*

---

### 🧪 3. Sub-techniques (Methods of Execution)
Granular details on *how* a technique is carried out.

Examples:
- `Control System Malware Injection` *(for Disrupting Nuclear Infrastructure)*
- `Exfiltration of Clinical Trial Results` *(for Stealing Pharmaceutical Research)*
- `ATM Cash-out Attacks` *(for Disrupting Banking Systems)*

## 🎯 Purpose and Value

This matrix provides value by:

✅ **Structuring Complex Knowledge**  
Organizes vast concepts in cyber warfare into an intuitive, accessible format.

✅ **Enabling Deep Analysis**  
Helps map observed activities or plan threat scenarios using a shared reference.

✅ **Facilitating Strategic Communication**  
Creates a common language for defenders, policymakers, and threat analysts.

✅ **Guiding Threat Modeling**  
Supports organizations in identifying and assessing relevant cyber warfare risks.

✅ **Informing Defensive Strategies**  
Enables prioritization of detection, mitigation, and proactive defenses against high-level cyber threats.

## 👥 Intended Audience

This framework is especially useful for:

- 🛡️ National Cybersecurity Agencies  
- 🧠 Military Cyber Commands & Strategic Planners  
- 🕵️ Intelligence Analysts  
- 🏛️ Policy Makers in National Security  
- ⚙️ Critical Infrastructure Protection Experts  
- 🎓 Cybersecurity Researchers & Educators  

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This matrix is a conceptual model based on a curated dataset. Cyber warfare is **fluid and ever-evolving**—new TTPs emerge constantly.  
Use this matrix as a **foundational tool**—a living framework subject to ongoing refinement and updates.
